# kernel_configs
Linux kernel configs for computers I have known and used

For now, I'll name the configs after the DMI strings of the PCs they're meant for.
I'll try to document each one separately.

## Satellite_C55-B.config
This is for a Toshiba Satellite C55-B5201 laptop. It's powered by a Bay Trail notebook
Celeron processor and carries Intel HD Graphics (which are driven by the kernel's i915
driver.) I no longer own this computer, so there will be no further changes to this
config.

## Presario_CQ57.config
This is for a Compaq (now HP) Presario CQ57 laptop, powered by AMD's E-300 APU. Note
this kernel was only tested with Alpine Linux. Right now, there's no support built in
for the laptop's webcam or card reader.
